              The Validation Hub is intended to be a clearinghouse
              for the transfer of novel algorithms and software from the
              research community to industry. The primary function of the
              Hub will be for developers to submit executable code which will
              run on hosted data sets. Developers will receive private reports
              on the accuracy and performance (e.g., run-time) of the submitted
              algorithms, and public high level summaries will be hosted. These
              summaries will indicate the organization who submitted the algorithm
              (e.g., links to GitHub pages, documentation websites, etc.),
              high-level accuracy metrics, and standardized performance metrics.
              These results will be stored in a publicly available database,
              accessible through the Hub, with the ability for users to sort and
              filter the results. In short, the Hub will be presented to public
              users as a collection of interactive leaderboards, organized around
              specific analysis tasks pertinent to the PV data science community.
              These tasks include things such as the estimation of various PV loss
              factors and the detection of various operational issues, to be
              defined in this document.
